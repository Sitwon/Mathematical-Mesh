=GTK# Crib sheet

The biggest problem in dealing with any GUI toolkit is working out which of the hundreds
of different events, properties, etc. actually matter and how to extract values, etc.
from the widgets.

GTK# is particularly complex as there are inconvenience routines for pretty much everything.

== Text display

Use the Entry or Label widget

The text displayed is in 'Text'

== Button

Use the Button widget

* Label - the text to display
* Clicked - called when clicked

== Checkbox

* Active - the value of the widget (!)

== Window

* DeleteEvent - called when close window is clicked
