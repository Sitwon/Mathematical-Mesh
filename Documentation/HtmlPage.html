    <h1>MatheMatical Mesh: IANA Registrations </h1>

    <p>The MatheMatical Mesh requires the following registrations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>SRV Prefix for portal discovery: _mmmi.</li>
        <li>SRV Prefix for intermesh discovery</li>


    </ul>


    The relevant authorities are:


    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6335.txt">RFC 6335 </a></li>


    </ul>

    <h2>SRV Template</h2>

    <pre>
Service Name (REQUIRED):           mmm
Transport Protocol(s) (REQUIRED):  TCP, UDP
Assignee (REQUIRED)                Phillip Hallam-Baker <phill@hallambaker.com>
Contact (REQUIRED)                 Phillip Hallam-Baker <phill@hallambaker.com>
Description (REQUIRED)

Access protocol for the Mathe-Matical Mesh. The Mesh is a PKI that allows
a personal user to share credentials and application configuration data
between devices in an entirely seamless fashion.
 

Reference (REQUIRED)

The protocol does not make use of IP Broadcast, Multicast or Anycast.

For the time being we would like the application to be considered under the 
'proprietary' rules. The reference code for the protocol is generated from a
machine readable specification. We anticipate making rapid changes to the 
specification during development and would prefer to release an initial Internet 
Draft that reflects experience from alpha testing. 


Port Number (OPTIONAL)            None

Service Code (REQUIRED for DCCP only)   None

Known Unauthorized Uses (OPTIONAL)

None.

Assignment Notes (OPTIONAL)

At this point we are only seeking pre-assignment of the code point _mmm._tcp so
that we can use SRV based discovery in the alpha deployment trial.
