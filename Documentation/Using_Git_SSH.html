    <h1>Using SSH and Git on Windows</h1>

    <h2>Why this is hard</h2>

    <p>Configuration of SSH involves a bootstrap problem. You want to 
    authenticate to a device. But before you can authenticate to the device 
    you have to log into the device so you need to register your public key.
    Which means you have to authenticate to the device.</p>

    <h1>My configuration</h1>


    <p>I have a git repository on my dev machine and connect up to a Linux boxen
    (Orac) which contains the gitolite server repository.</p>

    <p>Access is currently by either public key or password but I am working to remove
    the need for the password.</p>

    <h1>Automating via the Mesh</h1>

    <p>The Mesh could easily populate the directories used by SSH. But much better would
    be an extension inside the SSH server could pull information from the Mesh direct
    and validate the key chains.</p>

    <p>Best of all would be to modify the client as well so that this can push out the
    necessary credentials with the initial access attempt.</p>
