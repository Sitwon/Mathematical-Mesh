1. Definitions

1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Introduction

   The Mathematical Mesh is a personal PKI that permits a user to 
   connect multiple devices to a 'personal profile' through which 
   application information is shared between the connected devices. All 
   Mesh communications are secured through a combination of end-to-end 
   security to protect confidentiality and integrity and transport 
   security to provide protection against traffic analysis.

   A full description of the Mathematical Mesh architecture is to be 
   found in [draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture-01]

   This document describes a proposed design for a demonstration of 
   using the Mesh to provide a cloud based password manager for 
   connected Web browsers. The approach may be readily extended to 
   support management of Web bookmarks.

3. Password Management 

   Alice decides to use the Mesh to manage her Web usernames and 
   passwords. 

   She creates two accounts: 

         *   example.com: username 'alice', password 'secret' 

         *   cnn.com: username 'alice1', password 'secret' 

   The JSON encoding of the password data is as follows: 

   {
     "PasswordProfilePrivate": {
       "Entries": [{
           "Sites": ["example.com"],
           "Username": "alice",
           "Password": "secret"},
         {
           "Sites": ["cnn.com"],
           "Username": "alice1",
           "Password": "secret"}]}}

   The JSON encoded password data is then encrypted and stored in an 
   application profile as follows: 

   {
     "PasswordProfile": {
       "Identifier": "MBSHO-5D2GR-T7TNK-XHJV6-BHX5I-KA6TX-A",
       "EncryptedData": {

   BMN4sq6M34sC6Yc5nS3s1Q"}]}}}

   As we saw earlier, Alice really needs to start using stronger 
   passwords.  Fortunately, having access to a password manager means 
   that Alice doesn't need to remember different passwords for every 
   site she uses any more. 

   In addition to offering to use the Mesh to remember passwords, a Web 
   browser can offer to automatically generate a password for a site. 
   This can be a much stronger password than the user would normally 
   want to choose if they had to remember it. 

   Alice chooses to use password generation. Her password manager 
   profile is updated to reflect this new choice.

   {
     "PasswordProfilePrivate": {
       "AutoGenerate": true,
       "Entries": [{
           "Sites": ["example.com"],
           "Username": "alice",
           "Password": "secret"},
         {
           "Sites": ["cnn.com"],
           "Username": "alice1",
           "Password": "secret"}]}}

   Alice is happy to use the password manager for her general Web sites 
   but not for the password she uses to log in to her bank account. When
   asked if the password should be stored in the Mesh, Alice declines 
   and asks  not to be asked in the future. 

   {
     "PasswordProfilePrivate": {
       "AutoGenerate": true,
       "Entries": [{
           "Sites": ["example.com"],
           "Username": "alice",
           "Password": "secret"},
         {
           "Sites": ["cnn.com"],
           "Username": "alice1",
           "Password": "secret"}],
       "NeverAsk": ["bank.com"]}}

3.1. Bookmark Management

   The use of the Mesh to store bookmarks is an obvious extension to use
   of the Mesh as a password manage. The principal differences being 
   that the privacy concerns are somewhat less critical than storing 
   credentials and a bookmark file is likely to be considerably longer 
   than a password file.

   The principal design challenge in adding bookmarks is working out how
   to provide a convenient interface to help the user manage their 
   bookmarks. A hierarchical list of folders quickly becomes cluttered.

4. Application Schema

4.1. Password Application Profile Objects 

4.1.1. Structure: PasswordProfile 

         *   Inherits: ApplicationProfile

   Stores usernames and passwords 

   [None] 

4.1.2. Structure: PasswordProfilePrivate 

   AutoGenerate: Boolean (Optional) 

         If true, a client MAY offer to automatically generate strong 
            (i.e. not memorable) passwords for a user. A user would not 
            normally want to use this feature unless they have access to
            Mesh password management on every device they use to browse 
            the Web 

   Entries: PasswordEntry [0..Many] 

         A list of password credential entries. 

   NeverAsk: String [0..Many] 

         A list of domain names of sites for which clients MUST NOT ask 
            to store passwords for. 

4.1.3. Structure: PasswordEntry 

   Username password entry for a single site 

   Sites: String [0..Many] 

         DNS name of site *.example.com matches www.example.com etc. 

   Username: String (Optional) 

         Case sensitive username 

   Password: String (Optional) 

         Case sensitive password. 

5. Demonstration

   A demonstration of using the Mesh to manage Web browser passwords is 
   described.

   The end goal in developing the Mesh application protocols is to 
   encourage application providers to provide native support for the 
   Mesh rendering extensions obsolete. Such implementation is likely to 
   be best encouraged through provision of a reference library in C.

   I propose implementation of a demonstration as follows:

   Platform Windows

   Browser: Chrome

   Approach:

   Integration to browser features to be supported by platform 
   independent extension module

   Mesh integration to be provided by a platform specific executable 
   written in C.

   For initial testing / canned demo purposes, the Mesh integration 
   module will be a 'stub' that access a data file at a defined location
   on disk that contains the PasswordProfilePrivate data structure. The 
   task of synchronizing data with the Mesh will be performed using the 
   Mesh profile management client.

   Further development:

   Implementation of the production extension by modifying the platform 
   specific executable. 

   Support for macOS by implementing a Mac specific platform executable

   Support for Linux by implementing a Mac specific platform executable

   This approach allows the platform specific extensions to be tailored 
   to the cryptographic key management capabilities offered by each 
   platform. For example, the use of a TPM to protect private keys on 
   Windows or the Keyring mechanism on macOS.
