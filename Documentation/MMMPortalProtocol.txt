               Mathematical Mesh: Client-Service Protocol
            draft-hallambaker-mathematical-mesh-protocols-00

Abstract

   The Mathematical Mesh ?The Mesh? is an end-to-end secure 
   infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and 
   credential data between multiple user devices. The core protocols of 
   the Mesh are described with examples of common use cases and 
   reference data.
