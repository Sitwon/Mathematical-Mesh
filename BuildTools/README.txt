The build tools in this directory should be sufficient to build the Mathematical Mesh.

Put the .bat, .ps1 and .exe files in your command path.

The .VSIX file is an installer for the rest of the tools in Visual Studio.
Note that it might be necessary to reboot the machine the first time the extension
is installed.

The extensions have only been tested under Visual Studio Community Edition 2015. 
They may should run under other versions but Visual Studio can be picky.

In addition to using the tools through Visual Studio, all the tools run from
the command line. I will make the complete tool set available in the near future
as a separate Sourceforge project.
