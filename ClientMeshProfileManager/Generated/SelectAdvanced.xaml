        <TextBlock TextWrapping="WrapWithOverflow" FontSize="20" 
            xml:space="preserve" Margin="25,0,25,25" DockPanel.Dock="Top">Every cryptographic key in the mesh has a unique identifier called
a fingerprint. The fingerprint is constructed using a mathematical 
technique that ensures that it is very improbable that two keys will
ever be created with the same fingerprint.

Fingerprints are presented as a series of letters and numbers. Some
people like to choose a key that starts with a particular series of 
letters. Either to make it easier to remember or to distinguish different
keys.

Take care however as every letter you choose will cause the key
generation process to take 32 times longer. So if selecting the first 
two letters causes the process to take a second, selecting the third
will cause it to take almost a minute, the fourth quarter of an hour, 
the fifth a third of a day and a sixth more than a week.

Another limitation is that the first letter in a fingerprint is
always an M and the second is always an A, B, C or D.
